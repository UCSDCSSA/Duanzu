## Platforms

The system has roughly two parts:

- Front-end
- Back-end

We are separating the development between front-end and back-end

### Front-end

The front-end library is relying on ReactJs and WebPack. For the CSS we are
using Materialize-CSS. All the instructions to run the front-end webserver
is in `source/react/README.md`. Follow the instructions to run the front-end
server and view the website in your computer in `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Back-end

Under Construction
